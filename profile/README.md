## About Me

I'm a paleolithic single dad, with an intellectually disabled son, who became a single parent six months after getting my BSc in Computer Science.
So, I work as best I can at night, and look after my son during the day. But over the years I have discovered a lot of instances of legal injustice
in the disability area that I feel strongly enough about to start a couple of support groups, so as well as compercial work, I also work for a
Couple of Not-For-Profits.
